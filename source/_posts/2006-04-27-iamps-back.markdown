Well, iAMP's back, I've decided to keep it as the default skin.. atleast for now... (by the way, the player does not have two stop buttons, I was too lazy to draw the pause button, so I just used the stop button as a substitute)

Newly Added features:

* ID3v2x tag handling (Rohit, et. al.)
* MPEG information reading
* Real time tag editing!!! can even update the tag while the song is playing!!
